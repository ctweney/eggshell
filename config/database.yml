# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
# If you use "postgresql" instead of "sqlite3", your password-free
# username will also need to have permission to create and drop
# databases. This is not a great idea in a shared environment.
